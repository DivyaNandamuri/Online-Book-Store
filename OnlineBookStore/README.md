# Online Book Store

In this online book store project, I will show you how to build a full-stack (MEAN stack) Angular 14 + Node.js with a CRUD Application. The back-end server uses Node.js + Express for REST APIs and connects with MongoDB database, front-end side is an Angular App with HTTPClient.

I will build a full-stack Book Application in that:

- Book has ISBN,title, description, author, genre,stock,price .
- Admin can add, retrieve, update, delete Books.
- User can buy and return books
- There is a search box for finding Books by title.



## Project setup

### Node.js Server
```
cd node-express-server
node server.js or npm start
```

### Angular Client
```
cd angular-14-client
npm start
```
Run `ng serve --port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`.
